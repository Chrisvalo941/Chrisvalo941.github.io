                         <h2>Brief History of the Domasticated Dogs</h2> 
                    </header>
                    <main>
                        <p>The dog is a wolf-like canid. The genetic divergence between the dog's ancestor and modern wolves occurred between 40,000 and 30,000 years ago, just before or during the Last Glacial Maximum (20,000–27,000 years ago). </p>
   
                        <p>This timespan represents the upper time-limit for the commencement of domestication because it is the time of divergence but not the time of domestication, which occurred later.</p>
                        <p>In 2021, a literature review of the current evidence infers that domestication of the dog began in Siberia 26,000-19,700 years ago by Ancient North Eurasians, then later dispersed eastwards into the Americas and westwards across Eurasia. This hypothesis is derived from when genetic divergences are inferred to have happened. Ancient dog remains dating to this time and place have not been discovered, but archaeological excavation in those regions is rather limited.</p>

                    <main>
                        <p>Genetic studies indicate that the grey wolf is the closest living relative of the dog.[5][16] Attempting to reconstruct the dog's lineage through the phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences from modern dogs and wolves has given conflicting results for several reasons. Firstly, studies indicate that an extinct Late Pleistocene wolf is the nearest common ancestor to the dog, with modern wolves not being directly ancestral to it. Secondly, the genetic divergence (split) between the dog's ancestor and modern wolves occurred over a short period of time, so that the time of the divergence is difficult to date (referred to as incomplete lineage sorting). This is complicated further by the cross-breeding that has occurred between dogs and wolves since domestication (referred to as post-domestication gene flow). Finally, there have been only tens of thousands of generations of dogs since domestication, so few mutations between dog and wolf have occurred; this sparsity makes the timing of domestication difficult to date.[5]</p>

                        </blockquote>
                        <p>In the Middle Ages, European nobles had close relationships with their dogs. Ladies doted on their fashionable lap dogs and noblemen often went hunting with their hounds — a practice that grew so popular that breeding hunting dogs became a trend throughout Europe.

                            We can probably credit the Victorian era in England with creating the kind of dog-friendly family households that ours resemble. Pet ownership wasn’t just for the wealthy anymore; having a dog was now considered character-building because it taught children how to be responsible. Ever since then, Britain has been a center for dog breeding, and the first formal competitive dog shows were held in Newcastle in the mid-19th century.
                            
                            From ancient hunting companions to highly trained service dogs, human-and-canine friendship has a rich and fascinating history. Learning to connect with and better understand our dogs not only brings you and your four-legged friend closer together but also connects you both to a history of friendship that goes back thousands of years!</p>
                        <p>Friendship between dogs and humans isn’t just a matter of history and archeology — four-legged friends make appearances in ancient art around the world!

                            Records show that in ancient Greece dogs were often kept in healing temples for their therapeutic abilities. These important members of ancient Greek society were depicted in sculpture and on painted pottery.
                            
                            Egyptian murals show pharaohs with pet companions, and sculptures, toys, art and even mummies of dogs show how important canines were to pet parents going back as far as 6000 BCE.
                            
                            Even leashes made it into ancient art depicting dogs with humans! Rock art in northwestern Saudi Arabia is the earliest-known prehistoric art depicting dog-assisted hunting.
                            
                            We’ve come a long way since the ancient world, but the desire to immortalize our canine companions in art is just as strong now as it ever was!</p>

                         <h2>Ten amusing facts about dogs</h2> 
                         <h3>Read time: 5 minutes</h3>

                        <p>Dogs Can Actually Fake Smile: Ever caught your dog looking like they're smiling at you? It turns out some dogs have mastered what looks like a genuine grin, especially when they want something. While it’s not an actual smile in the human sense, they’ve figured out that flashing their teeth in a friendly, non-aggressive way often gets a positive reaction. Whether it’s a belly rub or a treat, dogs are quick to learn that humans love a happy face. So, when your dog flashes you that goofy, tongue-lolling grin, they might just be working their charm!</p>
                        <blockquote>

                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Dogs Have an Amazing Internal Clock: Have you ever noticed your dog waiting at the door just before you get home or nudging you exactly at dinnertime? That’s not just coincidence — dogs have an incredible internal clock. They can sense the passage of time in subtle ways, like changes in daylight or shifts in household routines. Many dogs seem to know exactly when their humans are supposed to return, and some even get anxious if you’re late! They also associate specific events, like walks or meals, with certain times of day. It’s almost as if they have their own little wristwatch tucked inside their furry paws.</p>
                        <p>Your Dog’s Nose Is Unique: Much like human fingerprints, no two dogs have the same nose print. The ridges and creases on a dog’s nose create a pattern that is completely unique to them. In fact, some dog owners and breeders have started using nose prints as a form of identification, much like microchipping. So, next time your dog boops your hand with their nose, just remember: you’re being touched by something totally one-of-a-kind! It’s a charming reminder of how special every dog truly is.</p>
                        <p>Dogs Can Catch Yawns from You: Just like humans, dogs can catch yawns from watching others yawn, and studies show that dogs are more likely to “catch” a yawn from their owners than from strangers. This behavior is thought to be a sign of empathy. So, if you yawn and notice your dog yawning shortly after, don’t be surprised—they’re syncing with you! It’s one of those small, adorable ways dogs demonstrate their deep connection with their humans. And let’s be honest, a yawning dog is one of the cutest things ever.</p>
                        <p>Dogs Have a Sixth Sense for Weather: You may have noticed that your dog acts a little strange before a big storm. Some dogs start pacing, whining, or hiding before we even hear the first rumble of thunder. This is because dogs can detect changes in barometric pressure and may even sense static electricity in the air before a storm. Their heightened senses allow them to pick up on these shifts long before humans do. So, if your dog starts acting anxious on a sunny afternoon, it might be time to check the weather forecast!
                        </p>
                        <p>Dogs Can Actually See Some Colors: While it’s true that dogs don’t see the full spectrum of colors that humans do, they’re not completely colorblind. They see the world primarily in shades of blue and yellow, but reds and greens tend to appear more grayish. So, your dog might not appreciate that bright red toy as much as you think, but they’ll definitely notice a vibrant yellow one! Knowing this, it’s fun to choose toys and accessories for your dog in colors they can actually distinguish.</p>
                        <p>Dogs Have Been Known to Drive: There have been reports of dogs accidentally putting cars into gear and rolling down streets. In one famous case, a dog in New Zealand actually learned to drive a car in a controlled setting as part of a charity stunt! Of course, these driving dogs aren’t going to be getting licenses anytime soon, but it’s a fun reminder of how intelligent and trainable dogs can be. Just don’t leave your dog alone in the car with the keys in the ignition—unless you want a very surprising joyride.</p>
                        <p>Dogs Can Tell When You’re Coming Home: Many dog owners swear that their dogs know when they’re about to arrive home, even if they’re returning at an unusual time. Some experts believe dogs can smell their owners from incredible distances, but others think it’s more likely that dogs pick up on the daily patterns of the household. The combination of a dog’s keen senses and their ability to learn routines means they can often predict exactly when you’re about to walk through the door. It’s almost as if they have a little internal calendar marked with "Mom/Dad’s home time."</p>
                        <p>Dogs Dream Just Like Humans: If you’ve ever seen your dog twitching, barking, or running in their sleep, you’ve probably wondered what they’re dreaming about. According to research, dogs experience REM sleep just like humans, which means they likely dream in a similar way. It’s believed that dogs dream about daily activities, like chasing a ball or going for a walk. So, when your dog’s paws are moving in their sleep, they might just be chasing imaginary squirrels in their dreams. It’s both hilarious and heartwarming to think about!</p>
                        <p>Some Dogs Can Outrun Cheetahs: While it sounds unbelievable, some dogs can technically outrun a cheetah — over long distances. Greyhounds, for example, are incredibly fast and can maintain their speed for much longer than a cheetah. A cheetah may be faster over short distances, reaching speeds up to 70 mph, but they can only maintain that speed for about 30 seconds. In contrast, a greyhound can run at 35 mph for several miles. So, in a marathon, your speedy pup would leave the cheetah far behind!</p>
